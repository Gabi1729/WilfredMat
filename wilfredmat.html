        <p class = "rojitos">This is a very simple site created to support the topic of double integrals through short explanations and examples. This material is taken from chapter 5 of J.E. Marsden and A.J. Tromba, Vector Calculus 3rd Edition. I hope you like it. For a clearer view of an image you can hover over it, it will expand automatically.</p>

        <p class = "oscuritos">We consider a continuus function of two variables:<br>
            `f:R\subset \mathbb{R}^2->R`<br>which has a domain R as a rectangle with sides that are paralell to the  coordinate axes. The R rectangle can be described in terms of the closed intervals: [a,b] and [c,d].</p>
